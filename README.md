# Data Analytics on a Mortgage Dataset
Created on: Dec 2019
This repository contains the R scripts, project requirements, raw data, a report and analysis on a mortgage dataset conducted as part of the course "Introduction to Business Data Analytics and Visualization" (Course Code: ISEM3035). The analysis was performed by a group of students.
## Analysis Method
The analysis utilizes R Studio and Tableau for data exploration, regression analysis, and data visualization. Linear regression is employed to examine and predict the relationship between target variables and the mortgage. Tableau is used to visualize the distribution of mortgage and second mortgage in the top 5 states, aiding in identifying states with potential promotional value.
## Business Implications
The regression analysis reveals several factors correlated with the mortgage median value, including monthly owner costs, marital status, age demographics, and education level. These factors can be considered when making strategic decisions, such as choosing optimal locations for new branches or business development. By understanding the correlation between these factors and the mortgage median, the financial institution can make informed decisions to optimize its business operations.
## Limitations
The dataset used for the analysis covers the years 2011-2015 and is based on ACS 5-year U.S. Census Reports and U.S. Gazetteer Files. While efforts have been made to ensure accuracy, some variables may not exhibit linear relationships or carry significant business value. Additionally, the analysis focuses on the top 5 states and may not capture the complete picture of the mortgage market in the USA.
